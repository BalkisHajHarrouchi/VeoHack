Subject: Update on Your Application for Software Engineer Position

Dear John Doe,

I am writing to provide an update on the status of your application for the Software Engineer position at our company. I wanted to personally reach out and express my gratitude for taking the time to apply for this role.

After careful consideration, I regret to inform you that we will not be moving forward with your application at this time. While your passion and enthusiasm are evident, we were unable to select you as a candidate due to the following reasons:

* Your experience in software development does not align with the requirements of our position.
* You did not meet the technical requirements outlined in the job posting.

I want to emphasize that these decisions are never easy, and I am confident that you will find opportunities where your skills and expertise will be a great fit. To help you improve for future applications, I suggest:

* Gaining more hands-on experience in software development through internships, projects, or volunteer work.
* Continuously improving your coding skills by taking online courses, attending workshops, or participating in hackathons.

I encourage you to apply again in the future when your qualifications and experience better align with our requirements. We appreciate your interest in our company and wish you the best of luck in your job search.

Best regards,
The HR Team
